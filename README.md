# AI Project OS

**AI Project Operating System**  
Turn AI coding into real, auditable software engineering.

## What is this?

AI Project OS is an engineering-grade operating system for AI-driven software projects.

It does **not** try to make AI "smarter".  
It makes AI **obedient to real-world engineering rules**.

AI Project OS enforces:
- Clear project stages
- Frozen decisions
- Guarded code generation
- Mandatory audit trails

No freeze, no code.  
No audit, no ship.

## Why AI Project OS?

AI coding fails in real projects because:

- AI skips steps
- AI rewrites architecture
- AI patches instead of redesigning
- Humans cannot tell when AI crossed the line

AI Project OS fixes this by introducing **engineering governance**.

## Core Concepts

### 1. State over Prompt
Project truth lives in `state.json`, not in conversation memory.

### 2. Freeze over Generate
All decisions must be frozen before execution.

### 3. Audit over Output
Code without audit is not considered done.

## The 5S Workflow

| Stage | Meaning | Code Allowed | 
|------|--------|--------------|
| S1 | Scope | ❌ |
| S2 | Spec | ❌ |
| S3 | Structure | ❌ |
| S4 | Schedule | ❌ |
| S5 | Ship | ✅ |

## MCP-Based Governance

AI Project OS is implemented as a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server.

This allows:
- Claude
- Cursor
- Trae
- Local agents

To act as **governed engineering executors**, not free-form chatbots.

## S5 Stability Guard (Mandatory)

Every S5 task must include:

- **Context Refresh**
- **Change Fuse**
- **Pseudo-TDD**
- **Audit Record**

No exception.

## Who is this for?

- Non-technical founders
- Product managers using AI coding
- Teams tired of AI-generated mess
- Anyone who wants AI to behave like a real engineer

## Status

**v1.0 — Engineering Governance Stable**

## Philosophy

> AI should not be creative about structure.  
> AI should be creative only within frozen boundaries.
